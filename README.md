# OpioidDeathRate
The prescription opioids use is popular be using in some specific area, such as cancer therapy, and pain relief. From 1999 to 2016, more than 630000 people have died from a drug overdose. As of 2016, 2.1 million Americans have an opioid use disorder, and more than 63600 people died from drug overdoses, which makes it the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States (CDC, 2018). I want to use the statistics to dig into the related data and come up with the idea to help end this crisis. Since the different states have different limitation and policy for the opioid use, I try to connect the opioid cause death rate data with all the county in the United States. From that, I can use multiple algorithms to dealing the data, including data visualization to show the distribution for the affection.
